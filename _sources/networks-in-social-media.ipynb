In their work, they sought to automatically classify different types of activity on Twitter. They had a particular interest in differentiating between retweet activity that was spam-like (e.g., a bot account that repeatedly retweets a singular tweet) vs. successful information dissemination.\n","- This might conceptually relate to the concept of mutual information, whereby in characterizing retweet activity and content, you are ultimately trying to see how much the retweet content actually gives any information about what the original tweet was.

Essentially, their goal was to transmit information as quickly and as widespread as possible within a village. Achieving this goal entails finding seeds or central nodes as they're the optimal entrypoints for information diffusion (e.g., Gmail first invited leading bloggers to join and then added an 'invite friends' functionality). In this study, the researchers manipulated whether they spread information through village elders (high social status) or individuals that community members identified as best at spreading information (gossipers), likely due to how frequently they hear gossip that originated from that individual. Lo and behold, the latter was better at spreading information! (Truthfully, the definition of gossipers here feels circular to me, but I'm unsure how else one would define it.)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HkFDyG6QeDVA"},"source":["## Influence via predictability\n","- $Y$ influences $X$ if $Y$'s past activity is a good predictor of $X$'s future activity\n","\n","![fig9](images/networks-in-social-media/fig9.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"G3WpEuV7eDXx"},"source":["- You can quantify this type of influence using **Transfer Entropy**\n","  - How much our uncertainty about user $X$'s future activity is reduced by knowing $Y$'s past activity!\n","![fig10](images/networks-in-social-media/fig10.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yhXHOSIDIBUd"},"source":["- Unlike correlation analyses like mutual information, transfer entropy allows us to look at directionality in the information flow, as it assumes some asymmetry."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"vFXLmR3_eDaH"},"source":["Example:\n","![fig11](images/networks-in-social-media/fig11.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"O0XdBs5_yNHl"},"source":["![fig12](images/networks-in-social-media/fig12.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6H-KpWCE0JzV"},"source":["## Hol' up: Granger has some stuff to say (1969)\n","- This is a statistical hypothesis test that helps us determine whether one time series is useful in forecasting another time series.\n","- **Granger Causality**: If a signal $Y$ \"Granger-causes\" (or \"G-causes\") a signal $X$, then past values of $Y$ should contain information that helps predict $X$ above and beyond the information contained in past values of $X$ alone\n","  - Assumes the cause happens before its effect\n","  - Assumes the cause has _unique_ information about the future value of its effect\n","  - We don't _truly_ know if it's the cause (hence, G-cause and not cause), but we do know that if it is a G-cause then it helps our prediction, and maybe that's the next best thing when we don't know the true cause.\n","- A \"Real World\" example: if you're trying to predict the price of houses in your area, you might want to know whether the house prices of a nearby area have any effect (or predict) on the house prices where you live.
